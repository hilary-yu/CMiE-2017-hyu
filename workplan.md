# Work Plan (Draft 1)

**Project Due Date:** 12 May 2017


#### Introduction
------

The objective of this project is to code numerical solutions for the power flow equations for alternating current systems.


#### Project Scope
------

At present, the project will seek to implement both the Newton-Raphson and Gauss-Seidel methods for solving the power flow equations.
The code will be checked against (at least two?) test cases. The goal will be for the code to be robust for simplified power systems consisting of generator, load, and slack buses.

A comparison to the values found using the d.c. power flow approximations (in which a number of assumptions facilitate linearization of the system) might also prove interesting.

#### Project Tasks
------

**Working List of Resources:**

+ *Electric Power Systems: A Conceptual Introduction*, by Alexandra von Meier. (2006)
+ *Computational Methods for Electric Power Systems*, 3rd ed. by Mariesa L. Crow. (2016)

**Task 1.** Concretize conceptual understanding and write up drafts for the project 'Background' and 'Introduction' sections.

**Task 2.** Find appropriate system test cases to use as checks for the code.

**Task 3.** Read up on the Newton-Raphson and Gauss-Seidel methods for solving the power flow equations. Outline the steps and calculations for each method.

**Task 4.** Determine what outputs the functions should produce/print (e.g. number of iterations, the Y-bus admittance matrix, etc).

**Task 5.** Code the functions.

**Task 6.** Test the functions against the sample cases.

**Task 7.** Analyze the relative performance of the two numerical methods. (Possibly: Code up the d.c. power flow approximations and compare the values.)

**Task 8.** Write up the results.

**Task 9.** Revise and clean up the report for submission.

**Task 10.** Submit the report.

#### Working Timeline: (to be expanded)
------

+ **17 April 2017:** ~~Project deliverable #1 due (Github repository setup)~~

+ **24 April 2017:** Project deliverable #2 due 

+ **12 May 2017:** Final project due
